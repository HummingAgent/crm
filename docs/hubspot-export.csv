Dan is looking to automate the collection and processing of press releases from various websites, a task currently performed manually by a team in India. Shawn's Company and Services Shawn's 11-month-old company offers three main products: AI agents with voice, texting, and chatbot capabilities PrivateChatGPT (containerized in Azure, ensuring data isn't used for training) AI-agentic workflow services for automation The company typically has a $10,000 minimum for custom code projects. Dan's Business Requirements Currently pays a team in India about $300/month to manually check websites for relevant business news in Jefferson County. Needs to monitor approximately 250 URLs, including company news pages and press release sites. Requires the ability to determine if content is relevant/newsworthy for Jefferson County. Wants to avoid duplicate submissions of the same press release. Uses WordPress with REST API and has a core database system. Proposed Solution and Pricing Automation to scan websites, identify new content, and submit to Dan's system. AI could potentially be trained to identify newsworthy content. Estimated cost: $2,500-3,000 setup fee with $100-200 monthly maintenance. The solution would involve a database to track already processed URLs. The system would focus on content posted within the last 48 hours. Broader Business Context Dan's primary business builds software systems for business journals, working with approximately 120 journals across North America. The Jefferson County project is experimental but could potentially scale to other business journals. Dan expressed concerns about AI consistency and data privacy considerations. Action Items [ ] Shawn to send a quote for the automation project. [ ] Dan and business partner to review the quote and decide on next steps. [ ] Both parties to consider potential expansion of the solution to other business journals if initial implementation is successful. Transcript: Hi, Dan. Hi. How's it going? Good. How are you? Good. Where are you located? Liquid. Oh, liquid. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'm in Lone Tree, not far. Nice. Good. Nice. Well, thanks for setting up some time. Yeah, I'd love to... Love to learn like what you're looking for and I can kind of tell you like who we are and what we do. Yeah, I'd like to see what what you guys are up to for sure. See if there's anything we could use there. Yeah, I can kind of tell you about who we are. We're about 11 months, like 11. We started in January. We started with AI agents, with voice, and we have texting, and we have a chatbot. And then our second product is PrivateChatGPT, where it's... It's all containerized in Azure, where a lot of enterprise companies like this because their data is not getting trained on. We're using Azure OpenAI models, where the model lives inside Azure, where none of your data is getting trained. And then our third is our services. Our services are AI-agentic workflows. Pretty much automation. You name it, we've done all sorts of automation. We're transforming, you know, small businesses. from all sorts of different workflows, using agents, building websites, so we're kind of all over the board. Yeah. I mean, like, so the. So, I've got a couple of different businesses, but the 1 that I'm sort of most actively trying to figure out if it could fit some of the things that you're talking about would be our. We have a startup online business news site in Jefferson County. And we're trying to I'd like to find a way just to automate acquisition of. Press releases and then posting those to our site. So right now we use a team in India to do a lot of sort of the grunt work. But if we could just automate it so that it could go and just sort of scour various press release sites and then as well as all the news pages that we've gathered for. For all of the major businesses in Jefferson County, and just see if there's anything new that's gotten posted and then determine whether. You know, I mean, this is where it gets a little tricky to determine whether it's actually newsworthy, because, like, we don't really we don't give a crap if, like, scramble is just announced that they're going to have, you know, that they're going to release their court. and pushed somewhere where then a human being could just quickly review them and then post them live. That would be that would be better than having to go do it every day and just like have human beings go to each of the sites and scan down through them and see if they're talking about a business that's based in Jefferson County and so forth. So that would be the first thing that I could see would be potentially beneficial. Interesting. And so right now you have actually people in India just just doing web searches and doing this manually. Yeah, I mean, it's not quite as like it's much more targeted than that. I mean, it's we have a list of websites that we want them to go to and then they'll just. They'll just populate a form that goes into our data system to then I do the assessment of whether it's newsworthy or not, basically. We don't have that. And it works fine, but it's, you know, it's more expensive and it would, the more we can automate this, the better. And then spend our money with the team in India for things that really. Requires a human being right, right? Yeah. I mean, I kind of see where if you have the list you have, you know, like a cron job or it's be able to actually. Get the website, scan them, and then, you know, you could have a dashboard where you can say it's like human in the loop, right, where you can, you can kind of go down and be like, that's newsworthy. But I think we can train that AI to, you know, it's got intelligence where you can see. These are the type of things that we want to actually post. But, yeah, that's definitely doable. It is. Yep. All right. Well, can you show me something that, like, of how this would sort of work? So I can visualize it, like, can you have it populate a form? So, like, if I have a form that then would just submit it into our. Into our data system, doesn't have to be password protected, but a form that, you know, can an agent just go and like basically translate the. I mean, even I mean, we already have a system that will automatically take a URL and for press release and then rewrite it into an article and post it to our site. So it could just be as simple as just capturing the URL of the press release, so that would also potentially work. Do you have, so right now you have a form, is there like an API to the form? There could be. I mean, everything we do is driven with API, so it could post to an API. Then we could post it. I mean, yeah, I would see it would just be a, you know. And then the next step would be post it to the API. So yeah, there's there's multiple ways we can do that. Cool. So do you have anything that like, like, I mean, how was the setup or is it all just sort of like, we tell you what we need and then you figure out how to build it and. How does this work? Yeah, how this works, normally we work with clients like you guys and we kind of talk through, you know, what are your use cases? And then we can come back with a quote and then we kind of, you know, an S.O.W. and then. And then we can go from there. Okay. So what's your budget are you looking for? I mean, I don't know. I mean, we spend probably for this particular task. Maybe currently, I mean, we would probably scale it up and I mean, it's not inconceivable. We would. Move this into other into other geographic areas if we wanted to try a similar approach. I mean, this is just one piece of what we're offering in Jefferson County, but it's an important one. We pay the team in India currently something like $300 a month to do all that for us. We're not talking huge dollar amounts. Setting something up, we could spend more. But if it's going to be more than that on a recurring basis, then it's probably not. It's going to be worth it to us in the near term, you know what I mean? So if that's too small of a project for you guys, I understand we can circle back when we're... If we're moving into other markets, but I just thought, yeah, I didn't. So I, if you're doing a bunch of custom engineering, it's hard to imagine that it's going to be, it's going to be a fit right now. I thought you had something more sort of. We're normally like minimum 10,000 on custom code. Just because we're a small team and it's a startup, but we're happy to explore it. I mean, this is something that we do. And this wouldn't be a $10,000 job for you guys, but if you want, I mean, I'm happy to generate a quote and we can kind of go from there. Yeah, just give me a ballpark, you know, and then I can think about it. I guess, just like... I mean, one of the weaknesses, though, of course, with what we're doing right now is that, you know, we don't have the team in India doing all of that. They'll just pick up where they left off the next day. It would be ideal to be able to go through all the URLs. You know what I mean? And so our costs would go up dramatically if we were doing that daily. And so that would potentially make it more interesting. So. So just, yeah, I mean, just give me an honest quote. Like, don't try to come in low thinking like there's no chance, because I don't want it to be something where it balloons. Because- No, no, I think, obviously we, We want to make sure it works for you guys. But so how many URLs do you guys have? Is that, does it keep on adding every day or is it just your certain size? It does add over time. We try to find more, more companies that have their own news pages, but then we also just have it like check. press wire and all the major, you know, yeah. So it's it's on the order of like, maybe 250 something like that. Okay. I mean, that's that's a good number where you could have an agent obviously Turn through those and how often you want, right? And then, obviously, updating your database on the latest. So posting it to your form, what does that mean? Does that mean it goes to your website or? Well, I mean, to be honest with you, like... I mean, the thing that I would want to avoid is having it basically script the same one more than once. Right. For sure. So, I mean, theoretically, like, if you wanted to well, I don't know, it could go directly. Like, we just have a WordPress site. So WordPress has a rest API. So that, I guess, would be 1 option. We could just have it go directly into that. And then the other option would be we could have it go into our core database that everything actually runs off of as a submission that we would review and post live. There's a couple of ways we could do it, but I guess. You know... We would, the way we do it with the team in India is we actually store for every URL they go to, we store all of the ones they've submitted in the past so they can visually see whether they've already given us that one so they won't give it to us again. We could probably emulate that exact same model, but your agent would have to pull. We have a task queue, so it's basically just... Like, it's one of those things where, you know, 20 different people could hit the cue at the same moment and they'll all get served up a different record to do something with. Right, right. So we could, we could set something up like that for your agent. Like I just, I, it's not clear to me sort of how sophisticated your agents are and whether that's something like. It can work with, but it would be a JSON payload for each one and then they would, we would say yeah look at this, this, you know. Component of the the JSON object and look at this array of values and if it's already here, then don't add it. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I think it would just be a pretty much database, right? So if it's already been added processed, you turn on a Boolean flag and. And it's already processed, right? It's easier for you guys just to, like, I give you the URLs and then you just give me anything that's new. Yeah. And you guys can handle on your side whether you've already served it to us or not. That would also work. Right, right. Yeah, that would work. And so that would probably be easier for you. And so we would potentially only have issues. Well, probably not, actually, because if we if we just did it, it has to be posted, like, within the last 48 hours or something like that, then right. We really shouldn't have any problems if we kick this thing off with you guys, right? But I'm a little ahead of ourselves. Like, I mean, if you come back and it's, you know, $5,000 set up and, you know. $100 each time we run it, you know, and we want to run it daily like that's probably outside of what we're going to consider at this stage, but it's still be, it would still be good to know what's possible. And then I can circle back with you and. When we're a little further along yeah, yeah, I honestly see it as I mean a ballpark I mean, we'll just be transparent probably like 2,500 3000 is probably where I would, I would at least see, um, and, and, and monthly or, or that's just, that's just a one-time fee. And then, and then probably a. Um, just a maintenance fee is probably $100 and $200, but it, it, it wouldn't be every time, right? It would just, you could run as many times as you want. So, I mean, that's kind of where we would have to be just to take on this work. Yeah, that's not crazy. Yeah. Yeah, give it some thought. Send me over a quote and my business partner and I will look at it and I'll get back to you. Okay, that sounds good. So you guys run a data company? Yes, our primary business is a company that builds software systems for business journals. So it's not an inconceivable part of what I'm doing in Jefferson County. The Jefferson County project is not something that we're particularly concerned about being profitable on. We're mostly just kind of trying to build a new way of doing business, news, and data. And a lot of the things that we're learning from that, we're going to pass on to our other clients. It's definitely not inconceivable that this thing could scale out. So if I get more, a lot of the publishers that I work with, we work with about... 120 different business journals across North America, including all of the American City Business Journals, so Denver Business Journal, but also all their other, they have 40 some odd The thing, you know, we could either I could either engage you directly with them to do it or or I could basically extend it to them and just, you know, we could do it together but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and also don't want to over promise and under deliver because it's where I just have no idea and we I guarantee you, like, no matter how good it looks on paper, when you build it, like something's not going to work right, you know? And so, yeah, obviously we got to test it and make sure it works. But yeah, there's there's always tweaking and things like that for sure Yeah And I mean I've been doing a fair amount with with various AI APIs and stuff. And the thing that I've been struggling with is like, I guess theoretically it's getting better, but it's just so inconsistent. I mean, I've been programming for 30 some odd years, and it's just like, I just don't like that you get, you run something eight times and you get eight different responses, you know. Curious, what are you programming in it? What AI tools? I'm mostly just using chat GPT. Right now, I mean, I've done I do image generation stuff with Gemini because I think it's substantially better. Um, but, um, but I, I, I just use chat. And I just use rag stuff. I don't, I don't not like isolating because. I guess I just don't really give a shit. Like, we just, you know, we build our prompts from the data so it's exposing snippets of the data, but it's not like we're uploading the whole database. Plus, like, I just, I have to admit, like, I don't. entirely understand like how is if it's being trained on people's data like I do so much of my development work with just complete BS data. So if they're actually training on it, how are they differentiating what's real and what isn't? And if you aren't, then that's a problem. That's highly problematic. So I think from my perspective, because I know a lot of the publishers I work with. Are really anxious about the very thing that you're talking about. Like, we don't want to give our data away to blah, blah, blah. But, like, I feel like the real value proposition is not you isolate your data. So that's only using your data. It's not to protect your data, it's to protect the responses. Because otherwise, the responses are just a bunch of bullshit. If you decide you want to go talk to publishers and pitch some of your services, to me, it will resonate with them, what you said before. We don't want to expose our data to these engines and stuff, but that data is going to get there one way or another anyway. Like, I think that in the long run, the real value proposition for people that are content creators is to prevent. the nonsense data from percolating into the responses. And that's, I think, really much more valuable in the long run than this idea of not exposing your... Yeah, I just, you know, like a lot of the firms we're using, they have like a CFO agent, right, where they they're putting all their proprietary information. information, which they do not want to get out, right? Yeah, no, I get that. I get that. But yeah, you're right. Like, yeah, if you, if you have bad data in there, it's definitely going to. Give a bad response, but yeah. Yeah, and I'm just saying, like there's definitely places for it where you just, you know, obviously if there's highly proprietary information or financial or personal information, stuff like that, like it doesn't. You can't in good conscience be pushing that out there. But I'm just telling you, you start talking to publishers, they're all just going to be like, oh no, we don't want to be posting our article content. That's, you know, it's gonna get in there. Like, yeah, I don't know, especially if you're getting a public website, like, it's gonna get in there. Like, it's gonna get in there. Tweet it and some other site, and then they're gonna scrape. Totally. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's just a waste of brain damage. Yeah, for sure. All right. Well, Sean, thanks for your time. Yeah, thank you. I'll look for a quote from you, and we'll see what makes sense. All right. Sounds good, Dan. Appreciate it. All right. Appreciate it. Bye.

Oz discovered Humming Agent through a Google search for AI services in his area and was impressed by their nationwide SEO strategy, which creates localized web content at scale for visibility in major cities. Brian provides an overview of Humming Agent, founded in January 2025 by four partners (including Brian from Pax8 and identical triplets with backgrounds in MSP ownership, AI labs at Comcast, and marketing). The agency specializes in AI-first implementations, including assessments, custom workflows, and productized solutions like conversational AI agents (for handling calls, texts, and scheduling) and private LLM instances (e.g., a secure ChatGPT-like tool hosted on the client's infrastructure, supporting models like Grok, Claude, or ChatGPT). They emphasize tech-agnostic builds (e.g., integrating with Azure, AWS, or Google) to automate business processes, reduce costs, and enable scalability without heavy hiring. Examples include automating an MSP's support desk by ingesting past tickets into a vector database for 24/7 troubleshooting and escalating complex issues. Oz shares details about his company: It's a new venture with four people (Oz as the tech expert, plus a CEO, marketing lead, and benefits/investment specialist), currently acquiring 2-3 small MSPs for ~40 clients and ~150 endpoints. Oz has a day job he plans to leave soon and is focused on an ""AI-first"" approach to solve client problems, build trust, and drive growth through service expansion rather than immediate revenue. He expresses concerns about scalability, time constraints, and skill gaps in his team. The conversation covers potential partnership models (e.g., Oz consulting clients, outsourcing implementation to Humming Agent with revenue sharing or markup), pricing (e.g., ~$50k for major projects, $249/month for conversational agents + usage fees, $2,500 setup + $400+/month for private LLMs based on users/tokens), and comparisons to competitors like Hats AI. Key topics include AI for MSP operations (e.g., automated ticketing, SEO/web creation at scale for lead generation), client fit (small to medium businesses, including mom-and-pop shops for automation to enable business transferability or growth), and marketing strategies (e.g., using AI to build customized sites, blogs, and LLM-friendly content). Brian suggests introducing Oz to Kelly (the MSP-owning founder) for insights on implementations, pricing, and acquisitions. The call ends with plans for follow-up, including an email intro to Kelly, and Oz clarifying his real name while noting he wants to keep his activities discreet from his current employer. Oz mentions interest in Denver meetups but notes the distance from Idaho. ### What Oz Is Looking to Do with Humming Agent Oz is primarily seeking a partnership to leverage Humming Agent's AI expertise and resources, given his small team, limited skills in advanced AI implementation, and focus on rapid growth through acquisitions and client problem-solving. Specifically: - **Outsource AI Implementations for Clients**: Oz wants to act as the front-end consultant for his clients (assessing needs and scoping projects), then hand off the technical build and deployment to Humming Agent. This includes custom AI solutions like automating workflows, support desks (e.g., using past tickets for troubleshooting), conversational agents, and private LLMs integrated into clients' existing stacks (e.g., Microsoft 365/Azure). He prefers a revenue-sharing model where he marks up or shares profits rather than handling everything in-house. - **Resell Productized Solutions**: He's interested in reselling Humming Agent's off-the-shelf products (e.g., conversational AI at $249/month + usage, private LLMs at $2,500 setup + variable monthly fees) to his clients, potentially marking them up for profit. This aligns with his goal of offering AI services without building everything from scratch. - **Gain Marketing and SEO Support**: Oz admires Humming Agent's AI-driven web creation and SEO strategy (e.g., building localized sites at scale, incorporating keywords, and optimizing for LLM referrals). He wants tips, materials, or potentially a project (~$25-50k) to enhance his own MSP's online visibility and lead generation, though he's cautious about scaling too fast due to resource constraints. He sees this as something he could later resell to clients. - **Access Expertise and Insights**: With his team being lean and himself having a day job, Oz needs Humming Agent as a ""fractional AI CTO"" for deep technical guidance, especially on scalability, token-based pricing predictability, and use cases. He's eager to connect with Kelly for real-world MSP examples (e.g., automating support, acquisitions, and pricing strategies) to inform his own approach. - **Start Small and Client-Focused**: Oz's strategy is to prioritize solving client problems (e.g., efficiency in operations, cost reduction) to identify trends and personas before heavy marketing investment. He's open to phased projects starting with low-hanging fruit, with budgets TBD based on client willingness and projected ROI (e.g., growth or business transferability). He aims to use AI to differentiate his MSP, replace his income, and expand services once trust is built. Overall, Oz views Humming Agent as a scalable partner to accelerate his AI offerings without overextending his resources, focusing on client impact first while keeping things discreet until his exit from his current job.","192899474167","Oz Jones (oz@hyperplexsolutions.com)","","192899474167","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","235383483128","192899474167","296031939304","","192899474167","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Western Botanicals is a mid-sized supplements manufacturing company (approximately 150-200 employees, aiming for 30-40% growth next year) focused on producing capsules, liquids, powders, and related products. They are exploring AI and automation to enhance operational efficiency, particularly in supply chain management, customer onboarding, and sales processes, without necessarily increasing headcount. The discussion highlights their current manual workflows, reliance on tools like HubSpot (for CRM and pipelines) and a proprietary Pterod-based system (for quoting and ticketing), and the need for FDA-compliant solutions with human oversight. The core goal is to integrate agentic AI solutions into their existing systems to automate repetitive tasks, reduce bottlenecks, and support growth. They emphasize starting with consultation to identify high-impact areas, followed by phased implementation. Low-hanging fruit includes automating document collection from vendors and RFQ (Request for Quote) processes for supplier pricing. Broader opportunities involve data enrichment for prospects, quote drafting, and finished product specification generation. The company is selective with clients, values reputation and trust signals, and operates under volatility (e.g., tariffs affecting pricing validity for only 7 days). They have no current AI automation but use basic workflows in HubSpot and automated emails in Pterod. What the Client is Looking For Western Botanicals is seeking a long-term partner for AI implementation to streamline their workflows and save on staffing costs (targeting 10% savings on growth-related hires). Key elements include: Consultation Phase: Expert guidance to analyze their processes and recommend the best entry points for AI agents. They are willing to pay for this upfront to define a rollout plan, as they lack internal expertise in AI and want to avoid trial-and-error. Implementation Focus Areas (Phased Approach): Document Collection: Automate gathering vendor certifications, spec sheets, MSDS, etc., from a list of companies/domains. RFQ and Quoting: Automate outreach to suppliers for pricing (e.g., emailing 25+ vendors per quote), follow-ups, and initial quote drafting in Pterod, with human signoff. Data Enrichment: Enhance prospect data in HubSpot (e.g., annual revenue, business history, reputation) to assess fit and reduce risks like lead time misses. Onboarding Automation: Support tasks like creating R&D tickets, generating finished product specs, and DocuSign workflows, ensuring FDA compliance. Potential long-term: Stringing agents together for a seamless onboarding flow (e.g., from sales intro to production). Technical Requirements: Integrate with existing tools (HubSpot API, Pterod) rather than adopting new systems. Maintain human-in-the-loop for accuracy, especially in regulated areas like production/formulation. Avoid full automation where FDA requires paper-based documentation. Overall Expectations: Full-service agency handling both consultation and build-out. Budget is allocated, but they need a clear plan, quotes, and next steps. They're open to starting small (1-2 features) to ensure adoption, with scalability for future growth. Timeline: Open to discussions post their Supply Side West event (week of Oct 27-31, 2025), aiming for follow-up the week of Nov 3, 2025. They view this as an opportunity to empower teams, reduce monotonous tasks (e.g., copy-paste emails), and handle ~100 deals simultaneously without proportional staffing increases. Statement of Work (SOW) Outline This SOW outlines a proposed engagement between Humming Agent and Western Botanicals for AI consultation and implementation. It is high-level and can be refined based on further discussions. Pricing and detailed timelines are placeholders pending a formal quote; Humming Agent would provide these after internal review. 1. Project Objectives Identify and prioritize AI opportunities to automate repetitive tasks in supply chain, sales, and onboarding processes. Develop and implement agentic AI solutions integrated with HubSpot and Pterod to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and support 30-40% business growth. Ensure all solutions comply with FDA requirements, include human oversight, and deliver measurable ROI (e.g., 10% staffing cost savings). 2. Scope of Work The project will be delivered in phases to allow iterative testing and adoption: Phase 1: Consultation and Discovery (2-4 weeks) Conduct deep-dive sessions (virtual/in-person) to map workflows, review systems (HubSpot, Pterod), and identify bottlenecks. Analyze data flows, compliance needs, and integration points. Recommend prioritized AI use cases (e.g., start with document collection and RFQ automation). Deliver a rollout roadmap with phased timelines, risks, and estimated costs. Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept (POC) Development (4-6 weeks) Build and test 1-2 initial AI agents (e.g., email automation for vendor RFQs and document collection). Integrate via APIs (e.g., HubSpot for data enrichment, Pterod for quote ticketing). Include human-in-the-loop checkpoints for QA. Run parallel testing against manual processes to measure accuracy and efficiency gains. Phase 3: Full Implementation and Scaling (6-12 weeks, iterative) Expand to additional features (e.g., quote drafting, finished product spec generation). Optimize agents based on POC feedback. Train Western Botanicals teams on usage and monitoring. Set up monitoring dashboards for performance metrics (e.g., time saved per task, error rates). Phase 4: Ongoing Support and Optimization (Post-Launch, Monthly Retainer) Provide maintenance, updates for volatility (e.g., tariff changes), and new feature additions. Quarterly reviews to assess ROI and expand scope. Out-of-Scope: Direct changes to Pterod core code (assumes API access); FDA audits; hardware procurement; non-AI automation (e.g., full ERP/WMS rollout). 3. Deliverables Phase Key Deliverables Consultation - Workflow analysis report - Prioritized AI roadmap (document with diagrams) - High-level cost estimate and timeline POC - Functional AI agents (e.g., RFQ email bot) - Integration code/scripts - Test results report (accuracy >95%, time savings metrics) Implementation - Deployed solutions in production - User training materials (videos, docs) - Custom dashboards for monitoring Support - Monthly performance reports - Bug fixes and enhancements (up to X hours/month) 4. Timeline Kickoff: Week of November 3, 2025 (post-Supply Side West). Phase 1 Completion: End of November 2025. Phase 2: December 2025. Phase 3: January-February 2026. Phase 4: Ongoing from March 2026. Total initial engagement: 3-6 months, with extensions as needed. 5. Responsibilities Humming Agent: Lead consultation, development, and integration. Provide AI expertise, tools, and agnostic solutions. Ensure security and compliance in designs. Western Botanicals: Provide access to systems (e.g., HubSpot API keys, Pterod documentation). Assign points of contact (e.g., Devin, Cameron) for feedback. Participate in testing and training. Handle internal FDA compliance reviews. 6. Assumptions and Dependencies Access to necessary APIs and data will be granted promptly. No major changes to existing systems (e.g., Pterod) during the project. FDA requirements limit full automation in certain areas; human oversight will be built-in. Project success depends on accurate workflow descriptions from the client. 7. Pricing Structure Phase 1 (Consultation): Fixed fee of $X (e.g., $10,000-$20,000, based on 40-80 hours at $250/hour). Phases 2-3: Time and materials, estimated $Y (e.g., $50,000-$100,000 total, billed bi-weekly). Phase 4: Monthly retainer of $Z (e.g., $5,000/month for support). Payment Terms: 50% upfront per phase, net 30 days. Expenses: Reimbursable for travel (if needed), capped at 10% of fees. 8. Terms and Conditions Confidentiality: Mutual NDA to protect proprietary information (e.g., Pterod system). Termination: 30 days' notice, with payment for work completed. Acceptance: Deliverables accepted via sign-off within 10 business days. Governing Law: State of Colorado. This SOW is non-binding until signed. Humming Agent proposes a follow-up call the week of November 3, 2025, to refine details and provide a formal quote.","Western Botanicals","Cameron Porcaro (it@westernbotanicals.com)","","Western Botanicals","","","","","","","","","Humming Agent <> Western Botanicals - AI Implementation sync;Humming Agent <> Western Botanicals: Follow up Conversation","","","","","","","","","","","","","224432569054;225726444242;226927153885;227068037854;244513858252;261933652685","","","","","","","","","","229414342335;231715537657","159973855968","250768488140","","159973855968","","","","","","","","","227291540190;231733641922","","","","",""

Initial Connection and Context: Justin apologizes for being slightly late due to a household clock mismatch. The chat begins informally, touching on their weekends: Justin describes yard work on his acre in Monument, Colorado, including dealing with pine needles and a local dumping spot in Black Forest. Brian, from Evergreen, shares similar experiences with pine needles and appreciates the break from screen time. They transition to business, with Brian providing an overview of Humming Agent AI, a full-service AI agency specializing in implementing AI-driven workflows for automation across entire businesses, departments, roles, or specific processes. Humming Agent AI’s Work: Brian details their approach: starting with client assessments on goals, stakeholders, and current tech, then building or integrating AI solutions to achieve desired outcomes while leveraging existing data. Key examples: Automating a support department by ingesting 10,000 past tickets into a knowledge base, creating voice and ChatGPT-like agents integrated with an ERP system for personalized troubleshooting, ticket logging, and escalation. Digitizing a legacy newsletter business for lawyers (serving comps from Colorado legal cases) by ingesting 20 years of data into a searchable platform, enabling automated reports and making the business transferable to the next generation. Brian's background includes co-founding a co-working software company and automating seven locations in Western Colorado during COVID to run employee-free. His team includes partners like Shawn Kercher (CTO, with 15 years at Comcast AI Labs), an MSP expert, and a staffing agency owner, allowing tailored AI-first solutions across diverse tech stacks. Justin’s Role and Gloo 360’s Needs: Justin is joining Gloo 360 (a February 2025-launched subsidiary of Gloo) on November 10, 2025, to lead technology and operations. Gloo 360 absorbs full IT stacks (people, processes, tools) for large nonprofits ($50M+ revenue) and churches, matching current opex while upskilling teams and modernizing operations. Success metrics: Nearly profitable in nine months, with a pipeline to triple business in the next year and access to Gloo's network of 100,000 global churches. They're building trusted relationships with major nonprofits ($500M+ scale). Challenges: Talent Scaling: Leadership gaps in performance evaluations, comp reviews, and accountability; shifting from a bonus-heavy culture to standards-based management. Efficiency: Overloaded staff context-switching across client tools (e.g., Salesforce, Workday, HubSpot), needing a unified ""single pane of glass"" AI portal for tasks like onboarding/offboarding or password resets. Gloo's separate AI unit is developing a faith-aligned LLM (customizable for Bible translations, hallucination-free), but it's too focused to assist Gloo 360. Potential Collaboration: Brian proposes Humming Agent AI's private, infrastructure-hosted ChatGPT-like environment as a foundation—customizable with agents for HR, IT, etc., in a unified interface. Additional UI could consolidate tools if needed. His partners' expertise (e.g., Shawn on AI architecture, the MSP partner on IT/security, the staffing expert on talent metrics) aligns with Gloo 360's growth pains. Justin sees strong synergy for scaling margins beyond one-to-one services, envisioning a top-layer AI orchestrator over siloed tools. He mentions his Kellogg AI executive program, daily ChatGPT use, and side business (Summit Wise retreats), plus exposure to AI risk platforms in finance. Next Steps: Brian suggests introducing Justin to Shawn Kercher (CTO) for a deep dive on Gloo 360's assets, architecture, and prioritization—potentially starting with Shawn as a fractional CTO to roadmap scalable solutions (e.g., quick-rollout tech vs. custom builds). Justin agrees enthusiastically, requesting an email intro for prompt scheduling. He emphasizes his pre-start influence and the exploding pipeline necessitating action. Both note personal ties (Brian's friend at Gloo, his pastor father's church insights) and excitement for the fit. Updated Needs at Gloo 360 The correction doesn't alter Gloo 360's core requirements, but it ensures accurate partner outreach. Priorities remain: Human Capital Management: Robust processes for performance reviews, hiring/upskilling, and offboarding to support rapid scaling without diluting quality. Operational Efficiency and Scalability: A centralized AI portal aggregating CRM/HR/IT tools to minimize context-switching and enable self-service for clients (e.g., ""How do I onboard an employee?""). Technology Integration and AI Solutions: Custom, AI-first automations integrated with client stacks; a private, domain-specific AI environment (e.g., Humming Agent's offering) tailored for nonprofit/church contexts. Strategic Architecture and Prioritization: Fractional CTO guidance (e.g., from Shawn Kercher) to audit assets, sequence initiatives, and design for 3x growth. Partnership for Implementation: Collaborate with Humming Agent AI for pilots, focusing on high-ROI automations to boost margins and client satisfaction. Recommended Next Steps (Revised) Immediate: Proceed with Brian's email intro to Shawn Kercher for a virtual deep-dive meeting post-Justin's November 10 start (or sooner if feasible). Prepare by outlining Gloo 360's tech stack, use cases, and growth projections. Short-Term: Pilot a ""single pane of glass"" prototype with Humming Agent AI, targeting 1-2 client workflows (e.g., HR automation). Long-Term: Formalize partnership to co-develop scalable AI tools, leveraging Shawn's Comcast-honed expertise for secure, enterprise-grade integrations.","Gloo","Justin Stouder (justin.stouder@gmail.com)","","Gloo","","","","","","","","","Justin <> Shawn: Humming Agent <> Gloo","","","","","","","","","","","","","238669680346;238715110092;238747517676;239966128856;240118359752;240316071633","","","","","","","","","","238308633303","42577536729","292721631943","","42577536729","","","","","","","","","238774372076","","","","",""

Carter reached out after connecting with Sean (likely a colleague of Brian's) on LinkedIn, coinciding with her exploration of AI tools like Simple AI. The discussion focused on Carter's background in startups, Techstars, and VC, and her current challenges in modernizing the outdated, paper-based business (e.g., QuickBooks Desktop, printed emails, no sales/marketing strategy). Brian introduced Humming Agent as a full-service AI agency specializing in automating business departments, workflows, and custom solutions (e.g., private ChatGPT-like tools, conversational agents) while remaining agnostic to tech stacks. Carter detailed operational inefficiencies, her use of AI tools like ChatGPT for minor tasks, and her desire to build scalable infrastructure before ramping up sales/marketing in 2026. She expressed frustration with past agency experiences (wasted money on undelivered projects) and emphasized wanting partnerships that equip her to manage ongoing AI strategies. Brian shared examples of similar client work (e.g., automating a legal newsletter business) and proposed next steps: a deeper assessment call with Sean to outline phased projects, budgets, and solutions. The call ended positively, with Brian noting a minimum engagement around $10K and plans for a follow-up. Key themes included AI for efficiency/automation, avoiding siloed tools, building internal knowledge bases/product catalogs, and transitioning from reactive to strategic operations. Carter highlighted the business's strong inbound leads (10-15/day) despite zero marketing spend, repeat customers, and potential for growth from $4M to $10M in 5 years. ### Areas Carter is Looking to Build Out for Her Company Carter identified several pain points and opportunities for AI-driven improvements, primarily focused on operational infrastructure to support scaling, data visibility, and efficiency. These include: - **Integration Between QuickBooks Online and HubSpot**: QuickBooks handles estimates, invoices, and financials, but lacks seamless sync with HubSpot (used minimally for email tracking). She wants automated data flow to avoid duplicate entry, enable pipeline visibility (e.g., conversion rates, average deal size, days to close), and track trends. She noted the native integration is poor and explored tools like Make.com or Zapier but lacks development skills. - **SKU Standardization and Analysis**: The business has ~1,000 disorganized SKUs (e.g., duplicates for minor variations like color). She wants AI to standardize them, update QuickBooks, identify high-margin/high-performing products, and inform sales/marketing strategies (e.g., focus on easiest-to-sell, unique items). - **Internal Product Catalog and SOPs**: With ~75 manufacturers and diverse products (e.g., chairs, tables, custom bar stools, drop-leaf kits), there's no centralized knowledge base. She needs AI to ingest spreadsheets/inventory data, create SOPs (e.g., product options, nuances, manufacturer tweaks), spec sheets, and a searchable database to reduce time spent on vendor research (currently 30+ minutes per query) and enable training/hiring. - **Vendor and Inventory Management**: Streamline info on manufacturers (e.g., capabilities, historical data) to handle queries quickly. Focus on niches like drop-leaf kits (held in inventory, high-margin, e-commerce potential) and reduce reliance on 70+ vendors. - **Overall Infrastructure for Sales/Marketing Ramp-Up**: Before investing in marketing (e.g., social media, strategy via ChatGPT), build systems to avoid ""whack-a-mole"" scaling. This includes dashboards for metrics visualization, automating workflows (e.g., from outdated paper-based processes), and creating assets for internal use (e.g., training) and external partners. - **General AI Adoption and Prioritization**: Help decide where to start amid ""noise"" (e.g., too many potential projects), emphasizing ""man plus machine"" to avoid over-reliance on tools like ChatGPT. She wants learnable, maintainable solutions rather than black-box handoffs. Carter emphasized working ""on"" the business (strategy) vs. ""in"" it (daily reactions), learning from implementations, and avoiding past agency pitfalls (e.g., overhead, non-delivery). ### Suggested Phasing for a Project Based on the conversation, we can phase the project to start small, deliver quick wins, and build iteratively, aligning with Carter's budget concerns (~$10K minimum) and desire for partnership/education. Phases would stem from an initial assessment (as Brian proposed), focusing on high-impact areas like data integration and visibility. Estimated timelines and costs are placeholders—refine via the assessment call with Sean. - **Phase 0: Assessment and Planning (1-2 weeks, ~$1-2K)**: Conduct a deeper call/review with Carter (and her husband if needed) to audit tech stack (QuickBooks, HubSpot, spreadsheets), data sources, and goals. Output: A deck outlining prioritized projects, timelines, budgets, and ROI (e.g., time savings, revenue insights). This ensures alignment and avoids over-scoping. - **Phase 1: Data Integration and Dashboard Visualization (4-6 weeks, ~$4-6K)**: Focus on QuickBooks-HubSpot integration using AI-agnostic tools (e.g., custom APIs/Zapier enhancements via AI automation). Build a dashboard for key metrics (e.g., conversion rates, pipeline health, deal trends). Quick win: Automate data sync to eliminate duplicates. Train Carter on usage/maintenance. Outcome: Immediate visibility to inform decisions, reducing ""whack-a-mole"" operations. - **Phase 2: SKU Standardization and Product Analysis (4-6 weeks, ~$3-5K)**: Ingest QuickBooks/inventory data into an AI tool (e.g., custom agent or private knowledge base). Use AI to deduplicate/standardize SKUs, calculate margins/performance, and generate reports (e.g., top products by profit/ease). Integrate with Phase 1 dashboard. Outcome: Data-driven sales/marketing focus (e.g., prioritize high-margin items like drop-leaf kits). - **Phase 3: Internal Knowledge Base and SOP Creation (6-8 weeks, ~$3-5K)**: Build a searchable product catalog/database (e.g., AI-powered portal ingesting manufacturer data, spreadsheets, historical notes). Automate SOP/spec sheet generation for products/vendors. Include vendor management features (e.g., query ""options for this chair""). Train Carter on updates/queries. Outcome: Reduce research time, enable hiring/training, and support niche carving for growth. - **Ongoing Support/Phase 4: Sales/Marketing Automation and Optimization (Ongoing retainer, ~$1-2K/month post-launch)**: Once infrastructure is solid, automate marketing (e.g., AI for content/social strategy) and sales workflows. Monitor/iterate based on data. Include periodic check-ins for tweaks/expansions. This phased approach starts with low-hanging fruit (integration/metrics) for quick value, scales to knowledge-building, and positions us as long-term partners. Total initial cost could fit within $10-15K, with flexibility based on assessment. ### Website for Her Company - https://kpetersonpersn.com (Note: This appears to be a potential transcription error in the provided text; it may refer to ""kpetersonfurniture.com"" or a similar domain based on context about a commercial furniture dealer.

The discussion started casually, with Sam mentioning personal challenges like finding a new apartment. It quickly shifted to Sam's recent deep dive into using Replit AI for building internal apps, which he found more efficient than hiring developers (e.g., he built a production planner MVP in 3 months after spending $9K on a developer). He highlighted the value of hands-on problem-solving and expressed interest in Brian's company due to their local Colorado presence, allowing in-person facility visits to understand operational issues. Sam emphasized operational and manufacturing efficiencies over marketing, sharing his screen to demo two apps he built: Production Planner: Tracks manufacturing cycles, operator performance, and workloads; auto-assigns tasks based on historical data to optimize weekly planning. Repairs Portal: Manages warranty repairs for lifetime-guaranteed products, including customer self-service for address updates, item selection, resizing, tracking statuses via Shippo SDK, and admin tools for Slack integration, label printing, and analytics (e.g., defect tracking, shipping costs). This reduced support tickets and errors like outdated addresses. Sam noted he spends 20+ hours/week on such projects and sees potential for more (e.g., customer-facing or internal tools), leveraging their tech stack. He believes external expertise could uncover ""low-hanging fruit"" he's missing. Brian praised Sam's tech adoption, aligning it with their services: AI assessments, automations, and integrations to boost team capacity. He shared common client use cases and high-impact tools, including: Agentic solutions for automated communication (e.g., emails/texts/calls for onboarding or updates). Private GPTs with ingested data for specialized agents (e.g., finance, marketing, sales) providing insights/automations. Examples: Automating legal case comps for a newsletter, IT support ticketing/chatbots/voice agents, website-integrated agents for product queries, and SEO/content generation (e.g., daily blogs, city-specific sites for organic traffic and LLM referrals). Sam identified two priority areas for potential collaboration: An internal knowledge base (ingesting his business knowledge so employees can query it, reducing him as a bottleneck). Automated document processing (e.g., parsing incoming vendor invoices/shipping emails to update Fulfill ERP with attachments, tracking numbers, etc.). Sam mentioned familiarity with tools like Parabola.io for similar tasks and asked about scoping/pricing for projects like document processing. The call ended abruptly as Brian needed to pick up his daughter from daycare. Next Things to Discuss The two key use cases Sam highlighted: (1) Building an internal knowledge base to capture and query his business expertise for employee use, and (2) Automating document processing for vendor emails/invoices to integrate directly with Fulfill ERP. Scoping out these projects, including timelines, implementation details, and budgeting/pricing (Sam specifically asked about costs for custom GPT/agent setups and used the document processing example as a ""straightforward"" starting point). General exploration of other AI applications tailored to Sam's operations (e.g., further automations in manufacturing, logistics, or customer support). Follow-Up Timeline Brian will reach out via email to schedule another call in the next few days (likely by October 23-24, 2025, assuming ""next few days"" from October 20). Sean (Brian's partner) will join the call to discuss the use cases and provide more details on implementation and pricing.","Atlas Pet Company","Sam Alter (sam@atlaspetcompany.com)","","Atlas Pet Company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","233280764644;234593398469;240049750739;254793602758","","","","","","","","","","232277640942","190466669253","292660035269","","190466669253","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Devon provided an overview of his one-person startup, which specializes in post-death administrative services: notifying state/federal agencies, credit bureaus, DMV, voter registration; running credit reports and sending notices to creditors; performing asset forensics; enrolling in anti-solicitation/privacy services; and generating a comprehensive client report summarizing all activities. He also mentioned expansions into offering wills/trusts (via software partnerships), secure digital vaults for document storage, drip campaigns, and potential estate/financial management. Current challenges include manual processes (e.g., clients emailing sensitive docs like death certificates, stored on Google Drive), context-switching between networking/sales and operations, and an upcoming marketing campaign launching around October 1st to expand into three new states via flyers and commercials. Brian shared ideas for AI-driven solutions, drawing from similar client projects (e.g., a legal newsletter automation). Key suggestions included: Building a secure, private GPT system to organize/client-specific instances for data storage, automate document collection (e.g., via templates and outreach), handle agency notifications/submissions, research state policies/assets, and generate polished reports (replacing manual PowerPoint templates). Website/marketing automation: Cloning customized sites at scale for SEO/keywords targeting specific locations, states, industries, or personas (e.g., hospitals in Jacksonville, FL, or estate attorneys in Phoenix, AZ) to drive organic leads without full-time sales staff. Devon expressed enthusiasm for automation to increase capacity and quality, preferring to prioritize operational streamlining over immediate marketing expansion to avoid bottlenecks. They discussed budget flexibility (Devon as a startup has some funds but wants value-aligned options), with Brian's agency aiming for long-term partnership by starting with low-hanging fruit. The call ended with scheduling a follow-up and brief unrelated snippets (e.g., personal conversations, a voicemail). Focus for Kickoff (Next Steps) The next meeting is scheduled for Friday at 10:30 AM with Brian's team (including CTO Sean and engineer Joey), potentially including Devon's fractional CMO. The primary focus will be a deeper dive into Devon's operations to scope AI/automation solutions: Documents collected from clients (e.g., death certificates, affidavits, IDs) and how they're handled/stored. Organizations/agencies contacted for notifications/submissions, including any login/process steps for potential agent training/automation. Current data organization/systems (e.g., Google Drive setup). Client report/packet structure and examples. Budget alignment, with Brian's team preparing low/medium/high recommendation tiers for phased implementation (starting with operations automation like data collection, agency outreach, and report generation). This will inform a tailored proposal, ensuring the build fits Devon's needs without overextending resources. Devon plans to formalize some materials in advance for the discussion.;low, medium, high project scope for Whitestone Estate Solutions Project Outline Based on the provided transcript, Whitestone Intake Form (PDF), and ""Wes Step by Step V2.docx"" document, the client (Devon Wittstruck of Whitestone Estate Solutions) is requesting automation to streamline their estate settlement process for deceased individuals. This involves handling notifications, asset searches, anti-solicitation opt-outs, and report generation after a death. The process starts with client intake (collecting decedent and executor details, documents like death certificates, IDs, affidavits, marriage certificates, or wills) and extends to interacting with various government agencies, financial institutions, and databases. Key goals include reducing manual work (e.g., form-filling, screenshots, hold times on calls), automating uploads and searches where possible, and compiling data into a unified report. Future expansions include will/trust services and a digital vault for secure document storage and family access. Core Components of the Requested Automation Intake Process: Collect personal/client info (e.g., full name, relationship to decedent, email, address, contact number) and decedent details (e.g., name, historical/professional/military info, funeral wishes, home cohabitants). Assess needs (e.g., probate info, tax implications, grief resources, property assistance). Gather required documents (death certificate, ID, affidavits, etc.) via secure upload. Preferred contact method and timing. Automation Goal: Replace manual phone/email intake with a digital form (integrated with DocuSign for signatures and uploads) and automated reminders for missing info. Use GoHighLevel (client's CRM) for follow-ups. Notifications: State agencies (e.g., email with death certificate to nullify driver's license/voter registration). SSA (call/mail; on-hold issue noted—suggest iOS 18+ hold detection or agent to monitor calls). Credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax—update as deceased). VA (dial 988 option 1 or va.gov). Red Cross (potentially skip; phone-based). Automation Goal: Auto-generate emails/forms, send via API where available, or use agents to fill/submit online forms. Anti-Solicitation: Opt-out from credit/insurance offers (dmachoice.org—electronic opt-out for 5 years). Deceased Do Not Contact List (ims-dm.com/ddnc—submit decedent details). Automation Goal: Auto-fill and submit forms, capture/print confirmations. Asset Searches: Government sites: VA, FDIC unclaimed funds, National Registry of Retirement Funds, SSA, Retirement Clearing House (IRA >$7k), PBGC (missing pensions?), MissingMoney.com (unclaimed property). Quick searches: Banks (e.g., Arvest, Capital One, Wells Fargo), life insurance (e.g., AARP, Prudential, NAIC locator). TruState/Trustate: Upload docs, initiate searches for assets/liabilities, credit cards, financials; handle client authorization email. Automation Goal: Query databases, scrape results/screenshots, compile into report. For TruState, automate uploads and extract results. Report Generation: Compile screenshots, confirmations, search results (e.g., assets found, accounts closed) into a PDF/zip file. White-label to look like Whitestone's branding. Automation Goal: Use OCR on screenshots to extract data, generate unified report. Future/Additional Features: Will/trust intake (manual for now, but automate form collection). Digital vault: Secure login for family to view assets/liabilities, docs (e.g., real-time spreadsheet). Background checks/financial forensics (e.g., CBI criminal, known regions/employers/banks). Integration with GoHighLevel for CRM/email reminders. Handle edge cases: Site changes, incomplete docs, client permissions. Overall, the automation should assume good intent (e.g., treat users as adults), be factual, and not moralize. For sites without APIs, build agents (e.g., using Selenium/Puppeteer) to simulate logins, form submissions, and data extraction. Security: Handle sensitive data (SSNs, death certificates) compliantly (e.g., HIPAA/GDPR-like standards). Full List of Platforms/Websites and API Research Below is a comprehensive list extracted from the DOCX, transcript, and intake form. I used web searches and browsing to check for APIs. APIs are evaluated for relevance to tasks like notifications, searches, or uploads. Where no API exists, an agent (automated browser script) can log in, fill forms, submit, and capture screenshots/confirmations on behalf of the client (with their credentials/consent). Platform/Website Purpose Has API? API Details/Notes Agent Recommendation if No API TruState/Trustate (trustate.com) Core platform for asset/liability searches, notifications, doc uploads, report generation.

Life Insurance Companies (e.g., AARP, Prudential, State Farm) Policy searches. No No public APIs; use NAIC locator or direct contact. Yes: Agent to query via NAIC or company sites. Good, Better, Best Development Outline This tiered approach aligns with the transcript's discussion of phased solutions. Costs/timelines are high-level estimates (assuming a development team; actuals depend on scope refinement). Good focuses on streamlining (semi-manual), Better on partial automation, Best on full automation with expansions. Good (Streamlined, Not Fully Automated - ~4-6 weeks, $10k-20k): Basic intake form (web-based, integrates DocuSign/GoHighLevel for uploads/reminders). Scripts to auto-generate emails/templates for notifications (e.g., state, credit bureaus). Browser extensions/tools to auto-fill forms on sites (e.g., DMAchoice, MissingMoney). Report template in Google Docs/Excel to manually paste screenshots/data. Manual oversight for TruState uploads, calls (e.g., SSA), and sensitive tasks. Benefits: Reduces time by 30-50%; no agents needed. Better (Partial Automation - ~8-12 weeks, $20k-40k): Enhanced intake dashboard (GoHighLevel integration) with auto-reminders and progress tracking. Agents for non-API sites: Automate logins/forms on TruState, anti-solicitation, asset searches (e.g., screenshots via Puppeteer). API integrations where available (e.g., DocuSign for uploads, VA/FDIC for queries). Auto-compile report: OCR screenshots, pull data into PDF (white-labeled). Handle client auth emails and basic follow-ups. Benefits: Automates 60-80% of repetitive tasks; still manual for calls/mail. Best (Fully Automated Solution - ~16-24 weeks, $50k-100k+): End-to-end platform: Custom web app/digital vault for intake, doc storage, real-time family access (multi-user logins, asset/liability spreadsheets). Full agents for all sites: Handle uploads, searches, notifications (e.g., auto-email/mail generation, simulate forms). AI enhancements: Parse intake/docs to pre-fill everywhere; monitor site changes; integrate will/trust forms. Integrations: GoHighLevel for CRM, DocuSign APIs, any available (e.g., credit APIs for verification). Dashboard: Track process status, alerts for manual intervention (e.g., SSA calls). Compliance/Security: Encryption, audit logs. Benefits: 90%+ automation; scalable for growth (e.g., add background checks).;Intake form & Step by Step Process:","Whitestone Estate Solutions","Devon Wittstruck (devon@whitestoneestatesolutions.com)","","Whitestone Estate Solutions","","","","","","","","","Devon Wittstruck and Brian Watson;Whitestone Estate Solutions <> Humming Agent AI ;Humming Agent AI <> Whitestone Estate Solutions;Humming Agent <> Western Botanicals: Follow up Conversation","","","","","","","","","","","","","232536293055;232807152316","","","","","","","","","","204952413929;231711195891;231974695617","164100703938","256687994571","","164100703938","","","","","","","","","204868366051;204971914955;216899952361;231733641922","","","","",""
